--------Comment------------
To comment your code, you can do it in two ways:
1. Place "//" (only //) at the very beginning of your code. This will only comment a line.
eg. // This line is commented

2. Wrap a section of your code with "/*" and "*/". This will comment a section of your code.
/*
  This part is also commented, so it won't be executed by the program either.
  This entire part is commented.
  Please learn how to comment your code.
  It is very important!
*/

// To decomment your code, just remove "//" at the very beginning of the line or "/* */" that wraps the code.
